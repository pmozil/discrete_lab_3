# Graph algorithms and decision trees
[![Open in Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pmozil/discrete_lab_3/blob/main/report.ipynb)

The code for the discrete mathematics lab.

Authored by [pmozil](https://github.com/pmozil) and [cyberprince2201](https://github.com/cyberprince2201)

The lab consists of five algorithms, four of them related to graphs, while the last one is a decision tree fitter.

These are:
- Prim's algorithm
- Kruskal's algorithm
- Floyd-Warshall algorithm
- Bellman-Ford's algorithm
- The decision tree
